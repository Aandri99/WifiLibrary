# SCPI red pitaya library
[![Build Status](https://github.com/RedPitaya/SCPI-red-pitaya-arduino/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RedPitaya/SCPI-red-pitaya-arduino/actions)

## Description

Arduino library for controlling Red Pitaya boards via SCPI server.

You can get acquainted with Red Pitaya products [here](https://redpitaya.com).
Information about SCPI server is located [here](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appsFeatures/remoteControl/scpi.html).

# Usage

The library can communicate with a Red Pitaya over UART or over TCP using any
Arduino `Client` implementation (Ethernet or Wi-Fi). Use `initStream()` for a
serial `Stream` and `initClient()` with a network `Client` such as
`WiFiClient`.

# Dependencies
 * [Red pitaya boards](https://redpitaya.com/stemlab-125-14/).

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  Not only you’ll encourage the development of the library, but you’ll also learn how to best use the library and probably some C++ too
